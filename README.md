This website is being created as an university project.

The task is to create forums for my game that is currently in development, so that users could leave reviews of the current state of the game, suggest changes and report bugs.

The Forum will be made with React.js, Tailwind.css for the frontend and Node.js , PostgresSQL on the backend.
